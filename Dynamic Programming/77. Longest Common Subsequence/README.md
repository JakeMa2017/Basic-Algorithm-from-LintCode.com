# Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings, find the longest common subsequence (LCS).

Your code should return the length of LCS.

Example  
For `"ABCD"` and `"EDCA"`, the LCS is `"A"` (or `"D"`, `"C"`), return `1`.

For `"ABCD"` and `"EACB"`, the LCS is `"AC"`, return `2`.

Clarification  
What's the definition of Longest Common Subsequence?

Dynamic programming is so powerful but it going to take a lot of time for me to understand it.  
Anyway, I got this solution from a CSDN post here: [https://blog.csdn.net/so_geili/article/details/53737001](https://blog.csdn.net/so_geili/article/details/53737001);
