# Palindrome Partitioning II

Given a string `s`, cut s into some substrings such that every substring is a palindrome.

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

### Example 1

Input: `"a"`
Output: `0`
Explanation: `"a"` is already a palindrome, no need to split.

### Example 2

Input: `"aab"`
Output: `1`
Explanation: Split `"aab"` once, into `"aa"` and `"b"`, both palindrome.
