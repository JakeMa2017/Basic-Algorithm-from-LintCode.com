# Remove Duplicate Numbers in Array

Given an array of integers, remove the duplicate numbers in it.

You should:

Do it in place in the array.

Move the unique numbers to the front of the array.

Return the total number of the unique numbers.

Example

Given nums = `[1,3,1,4,4,2]`, you should:

Move duplicate integers to the tail of nums => nums = `[1,3,4,2,1,4]`.

Return the number of unique integers in nums => `4`.

Actually we don't care about what you place in ?, we only care about the part which has no duplicate integers.
